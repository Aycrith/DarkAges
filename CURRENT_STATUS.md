## Known Issues & Blockers

### 🟢 No Critical Blockers
All P0 issues resolved as of 2026-01-30.

### ⚠️ Minor Issues
- GameNetworkingSockets using stubs (WP-8-6 addressing)
- ScyllaDB Windows support limited (acceptable for Phase 8 dev)
- No production monitoring yet (WP-8-1 in progress)

### 📋 Technical Debt
- Some test coverage gaps in network layer
- Documentation scattered across multiple status files (being consolidated)
- No chaos testing framework yet (Phase 8 WP-8-4)

**Note for AI Agents:** This file is the **canonical source of truth** for current project status. When starting work:
1. Read this file first
2. Check your WP status in the Phase 8 table
3. Update this file when milestones complete
4. Reference [PHASE8_EXECUTION_PLAN.md](PHASE8_EXECUTION_PLAN.md) for detailed WP specifications

**Update Cadence:** This file should be updated:
- ✅ When any WP changes status
- ✅ When server health metrics change
- ✅ When critical bugs are discovered/fixed
- ✅ At minimum, weekly during Phase 8
